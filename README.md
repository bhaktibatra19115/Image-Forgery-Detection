# Image-Forgery-Detection

The development in the field of digital images, lead to several approachable image manipulation techniques, which has made image forgery more easier. As a result it has become a keen concern for cyber crime community and if not tackled
accordingly serious issues can emerge. Deep learning and computer vision community had proposed several approaches to solve this issue
In this project we tried to solve the problem of copy move Image forgery detection, in which we have trained a deep learning model for feature engineering. For the classification
purpose we have used standard classifiers and compared the performance of each of the classifier.
